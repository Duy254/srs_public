This package provide likelihood calculation service to DEM from learning

HOW_TO:

step1: 		roscd srs_likelihood_calculation

step2: 		rosmake

step3: 		to make sure there are historical data avaliable,run the mimic historical data generator,which will randomly generate historical data

	  rosrun srs_likelihood_calculation generate_get_milk_historical_data.py  

step4: 		run the likelihood calculation service(in learning component), which can receive command and corresponding candidates from DEM and return likelihood
		for the corresponding candidates based on the historical data, this srevice also receives the historical data from DEM and record them as a txt file
		(now, if you want, you can shut down the generate_get_milk_historical_data node in step3 )

	    rosrun srs_likelihood_calculation server_likelihood.py

step5: 		run the client, which is the interface for DEM to send request to learning, 
		(in this stage, this service will prompt DEM to input command and candidates)

	    rosrun srs_likelihood_calculation client_likelihood.py

	example: 

	command: get milk
	candidates: table1 table2 fridge

	this client will receive the  likelihood feedback to DEM from learning

step6: 	run step5 again to make another request, run step3 again to randomly generate more historical data

      for more details, please refer D3.1 Learning for decision-making on prioritising
